# epitygmata-website
@FlyingCow31 's first project, remastered to make it become a real online shop. 

You can find the original website, made with odoo (and by @FlyingCow31) here: https://www.epitygmata.fr

You can also create a PR with the modifications/optimization (EXPLAIN THEM or I'll not accept them, I'm here to learn!)
